Welcome! I am a PhD student in Social Statistics at the University of Manchester, UK. My main research interests revolve around applications of Social Network Analysis and Computational Social Science. 
I aspire to apply advanced statistical methods to real-world problems and have versatile experience in working with time-series, spatial, textual and network data from different domains.

Here you can find general information about my [talks](https://artvolgin.github.io/talks/), [teaching experience](https://artvolgin.github.io/teaching/), and [data analytics competitions](https://artvolgin.github.io/competitions/) in which I participated. 
More detailed information can be found in my [CV](https://artvolgin.github.io/cv/).
